# Button caps design for resin printers
This folder contains ready to print STL files for resin printers. Buttons caps are compatible with 3+3+3mm panel layout made from acrylic. Fusion 360 source files will be added later.

Panel source file: https://github.com/MobiFlight/mobiflight-panels/blob/main/aircraft/airbus-a32x/pedestal/mcdu/A320_MCDU-laser.svg

**Please note** that even though I tried my best to make the design as good as possible, it may not be perfect because I am not a professional 3D designer myself. Moreover, your panels may differ even if they are from the same source data because of variables that I have no control over, such as the  your laser configuration or the thickness of the paint you apply to the buttons or the panel itself.

# What you need:
* Resin 3D printer (I am using Creality Halot One)
* White resin (I am using Anycubic Basic White resin)
* Black acrylic spray paint
* Masking tape
* CO2 or LED laser cutter / engraver

# How to slice: 
You can use your favorite slicer but my favorite is Lychee. You can use preconfigured scene files for Lychee or you can use STL exports. Both file formats are with integrated supports and this style of supports is in my humble opinion best for stability during prints and for easy postprocesing.

Test file with all types of buttons:
